## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (package managers)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mr-chidex/news-article.git
   cd news-article
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm or Yarn:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn install

```

3. Set up your API key for the NY Times API:

- Go to NY Times Developer and sign up for an API key.
- Create a .env file at the root of your project and add the following line:

```bash
REACT_APP_SAMPLE_KEY=your-api-key-here

```

Make sure to replace your-api-key-here with the API key you obtained.

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed and the environment is set up:

1. Start the development server:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn start

```

This will start the development server, and you can view the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser

## Running Tests

This application includes unit tests and UI tests using Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

### Unit Tests

1. To run unit tests, execute the following command:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm test
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn test

```

This will run the unit tests in watch mode. Press q to quit the test runner.

2. To run tests once and generate a test coverage report, use the following:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn test --coverage
```

This will generate a test coverage report in the terminal and create a coverage directory with detailed coverage information.

### UI Tests

UI tests are handled by Cypress. To run UI tests:

1. Open Cypress:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn run cypress
```

2. This will open the Cypress UI where you can select and run UI tests. The tests are located in the cypress/integration folder.

## Generating Test Coverage Reports

The test coverage reports are generated when running unit tests with the --coverage flag. The report will be displayed in the terminal, and a detailed HTML version will be created in the coverage folder.

To view the HTML report:

1. Navigate to the coverage directory:

```bash
cd coverage

```

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the detailed coverage report.

## Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting to ensure code quality and consistency.

1. To run the linter, use the following command:

- If you're using npm:

```bash
npm run lint
```

- If you're using npm:

```bash
yarn run lint
```

This will analyze your code and display any linting errors or warnings in the terminal.
